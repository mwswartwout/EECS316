There are six machines in the Lab to use for your work.
------------
hostname:

hp04
hp05
hp06
hp07
hp08
hp09

domain: eecs.cwru.edu
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You may login in the console using the group login name/passwd that
I will send you. You can also login remotely using ssh, for example:

ssh team05@hp04.eecs.cwru.edu

in text mode, or to do it in graphics mode:

ssh -X team05@hp04.eecs.cwru.edu

You can use any of the machines for your work with the password I will mail to you.
However, to change your password you should use the "yppasswd" command
so that your change affects all machines.
